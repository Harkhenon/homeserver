# Homeserver webpanel

## Wut? Another webpanel...?

Yep, I'm building Homeserver for my own server (on a Raspberry PI 4 8Gb - Ubuntu Server)
I make it really easy to install, easy to use for beginners and advanced developpers or just for people who wants to have their little server in their house.

## ...K, but what it do, is it really a professionnal webserver?

Nope, Homeserver isn't build for professionnals, for now, it's a really simple webpanel who can configure your server, install packages, run commands, install domains and install apache hosts.
No plans for professionnal, reseller or other stuff is planned for the moment.
Homeserver is just a personal project for testing my capacities.

## What about technologies?

Homeserver is built with a Laravel back-end and React front-end.
Also, a daemon is installed on the server for manipulating files (as root) from HS logs.
Laravel runs on an Apache2 and PHP-FPM system.
Homeserver can create two plans of hosting:

- Simple hosting with HTML, PHP and SQL Database
- More dynamic plan with the precedent and a NodeJS port available and with the yarn/npm command available

## And if I want to use it?

You can.
This repository isn't listed as private.
But I need to warn you.
This isn't a group project, I'm the only developer and I'm not Bill Gates, I'm an autodidact who develop with the holy passion of code.
So, use it at your own risks, I'm not a security specialist, but I do my best ;)

If the project is interesting for you, download the installer, and enjoy it, it'll be a pleasure.


Regards,

Thomas
